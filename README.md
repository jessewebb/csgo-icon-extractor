csgo-icon-extractor
===================

Python command-line utility for extracting the icon set used in the _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_ video game.

## How to Use

**Pre-requisites:** You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.3+) and [SWFTools](http://www.swftools.org/) (v0.9+) installed.

### Getting Started

- Clone this Git repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/jessewebb/csgo-icon-extractor.git`
- Change directories into the cloned repository's root:  
`cd csgo-icon-extractor/`
- Make a copy of CS:GO's icon library file (`iconlib.swf`):  
`copy "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource\flash\iconlib.swf" iconlib.swf`
- Run the csgo-icon-extractor command-line script (`main.py`):
